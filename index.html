            <h3>Kairi to leads ONIC Esports’ MSC bid</h3>
            <p>Filipino jungler Kairi “Kairi” Rayosdelsol will spearhead ONIC Esports’ attempt to capture its second Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Southeast Asia Cup championship this June.

                The former MPL Indonesia Regular Season MVP will lead the back-to-back ID champs’ six-man roster, which Moonton announced on Saturday, and will fly to Cambodia.
                
                Kairi will be joined by the championship core of Muhammad “Butsss” Sanubari, Sanz “Sanz” Gilang, Calvin “CW” Winata, and Nicky “Kiboy” Fernando. The team has also brought in Adriand “Drian” Wong as a reserve, leaving Thomas “SamoHt” Budiman out of their MSC roster.</p>

                <h3>MPL PH: Blacklist International averts disaster vs Bren in dramatic semis</h3>
                <p class="wais">Blacklist International averted a major upset, turning back Bren Esports in a 3-2 thriller to advance to the upper bracket finals of the MPL Philippines Season 10, Friday at the Blue Leaf Cosmopolitan in Quezon City.

                    The reigning world champions secured at least a third place finish and are now a win away from securing a spot in the M4 World Championships in January.
                    
                    Blacklist International will face off against ECHO in the upper bracket finale tomorrow.
                    
                    After playing from behind early in Game One, Bren Esports managed to pull out the stops needed to prolong the match against a surging Blacklist International.
                    
                    However, the Tier One-backed squad got the much-needed separation during the 28th minute when they scored crucial kills on Kyle “KyleTzy” Sayson (Lancelot), Vincent “Pandora” Unigo (Masha), and Angelo “Pheww” Arcangel (Yve).
                    
                    That proved to be it as Blacklist International went for the death push to secure a 1-0 lead.
                    
                    Edward “Edward” Dapadap (Benedetta) led the way with three kills, a death, and four assists while Salic “Hadji” Imam had six kills, three deaths, and four assists on Xavier in the tight 13-11 Game One win in 28 minutes and 38 seconds.
                    
                    Bren Esports bounced back in Game Two, taking an 11-7 Game Two win in 17 minutes and 27 seconds. KyleTzy’s Balmond led the way with three kills and five assists without a death.
                    
                    Game Three went the distance but it was Bren Esports who came out on top after securing a crucial pickoff on Edward’s Benedetta before stealing the Lord in the 30th minute.
                    
                    Rowgien “Owgwen” Unigo (Mathilda) paced the 22-14 triumph after registering a game-high 17 assists.</p>

            <h4>Tournaments</h4>

        <div class="Tp"></div>
        <p>Earlier in January, the M4 Championship beat Mobile Legends’ previous viewership record, showcasing that interest in MLBB’s competitive scene continues to grow.

            MPL Season 11 and official tournaments will commence from February to May, including the North America Challenger Tournaments (NACT) and a new tournament in Turkey. The seven professional regional leagues will take place in Malaysia, Singapore, Brazil, MENA, Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines.
            
            The second MLBB Women’s Invitational (MWI) will also be held in February with four teams from Laos, Singapore, Cambodia and Indonesia battling it out.
            
            Next, MSC 2023 will kick off in June featuring talent from all across Southeast Asia. This will be back-to-back with the 2023 SEA Games, which is set to conclude on May 17th.
        
            In July, MLBB will be included in the Snapdragon Pro Series organised by ESL for the first time ever. Teams will also take part in the World Cyber Games (WCG) Grand Final which is also happening in the same month.

            As the second half of the year starts, so does MPL Season 12, which will feature the same tournaments and regional leagues, leading up to MPL Invitational in November.
            
            The year will end with the fifth iteration of MLBB’s World Championship, otherwise known as the M5 World Championship.

        <h3>How to win</h3>
        <div class="left">There are three lanes in the game. The gold lane (top), EXP lane (bottom), and the mid lane. Between each lane is the jungle. If you’re getting confused, these terms will be explained a bit later.

            Depending on what side of the map (blue or red) you start on, the lanes will be in a different position. A good way of knowing this is by locating the turtle on the map. If the turtle is at the bottom, then you are on the blue side. If the turtle is at the top, then you’re on the red side and the lanes are rotated.
            
            To win, you need to take down a total of nine turrets that stand in your way, three in each lane. These serve as important defensive positions for both you and your opponents. You can’t attack the enemy base directly without taking down all the opposing turrets in at least one lane first.</div>
